Webform Node Element is a module that allows you to include node content as markup in a webform. NB The content type that you wanto to display must have a display mode named 'webform_element'.

1. Install this module

2. In a webform add a new 'Node' element. On the settings page for the node enter the nid of the node that you want to display. (@todo - leave empty to get the nid from a hook or event). 

3. When viewing the webform the chosen node should be displayed using the webform_element display mode.
